Removed sign inversion of input Y values from all fuction processes

function_1
We are seeking to find two maxima of this function.
Week1-week3 First 3 points simple guesses - best point 0.5,0.5 

Week5 Set up skopt with the Least common bounds estimator LCB and set kappa at 1.0 

Week6 - week 9  Bounced aboout the  corners of the domain without any real improvment

week11 - week 13 changed kappa to zero -  prioritized expliotation over exploration.  

week 14 - changed 
    best value 0.0023697618151689473

Most the points it has been commming up with are at the edges of the domain, typically (0,0),(1,0)
So have made the fuction less explorative by setting Kappa=0.0 see how this goes 

function_2
21/3/2025
Again the function has been seeking out point at the edges of the X,Y domain
Try setting kappa=0.0


function_5

Changed guassion process from "EI" back to "LCB" set Kappa to 0.1 ?
