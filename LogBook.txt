function_1

We are seeking to find two maxima of this function.

week1-5 
First 3 points simple guesses - best point 0.5,0.5 
week 6 
 Set up skopt with the Least common bounds estimator LCB and set kappa at 1.0 
week7-9
Bounced about the  corners of the domain without any real improvement
week11-13
changed kappa to zero -  prioritized exploitation n over exploration.
Slight improvement.

Week 14 -
changed kappa back to 0.1
best value 0.0023697618151689473


function_2

We are seeking to find the maxima of this function

week 1-5
 Simple guesses - best guess  0.6954167327128791 
week 6
Set up skopt with LCB set kappa to 1.0, using the default base estimator "GP"
week 6 - 10
Bounced about near the limits of the domain. no improvement
week 11-14
 changed kappa to 0.1 do less exploring, but no improvement


function_3

week1-5 
Attempted to work out the redundant dimension by permuting the values, of a single element.

week6 
Set up Gaussian process, acquisition function as LCB , set kappa=1
week7-10
best value = -0.0017902770546808788
week 11-15
no real improvement


function_4

week1-3
Guessed the points for the first 3 weeks- best -3.754695676825303
week 4
set up Gaussian EI acquisition function with xi=0.1
week5-10 
no improvement
week11
 Switched from the default "GP" to regular defined Gaussian processor aggressor.
week11-15
no significant improvement


function 5

week1-5
guessed the points
week 6
Set up Gaussian LCB acquisition function with kappa=1.0

week 7 - week10 
  no significant improvement  
week11 
    changed kappa to 0.1 
week 12 - week 14  
    No significant improvement.

function 6

week1 - week 5
Guessed the points best guess -0.6974609336778691
week 6 
add the GP with LCB, kappa=1.0  
week7 - week 14  
no significant improvement


function_7

week1- week5 
Guessed the points
week6
Set up the GP with default "GP" and LCB and kappa=1.0
week7 - week 9
no significant improvement
week 10
Tweaks to kappa and length scale
week11-14
no significant improvement


function_8

week1 to week5 
Guessed the points best guess 9.942722150418
week6 
Set up GP with "EI" and xi=0.1
week6-week8 
no real improvement
Week 9-14 
played with the length scale and the nu value but no real improvement
